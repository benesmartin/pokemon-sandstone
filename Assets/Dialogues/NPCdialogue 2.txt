Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of Pokemon!
My name is Professor Delonix.
But everyone calls me the Pokemon Professor.
Before we go any further, I'd like to tell you a few things you should know about this world.
This world is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokemon.
We humans live alongside Pokemon as friends.
At times we play together, and at other times we work together.
Some people use their Pokemon to battle and develop closer bonds with them.
Now, are you ready?
Your very own tale of grand adventures is about to unfold.
Fun experiences, difficult experiences, there's so much waiting for you.
Dreams, adventure, let's go to the world of Pokemon!
I'll see you later!
